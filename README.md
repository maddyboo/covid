# COVID-19 Open Data Analysis To Identify The Next Variant Of Concern

## Objective

COVID variants are cropping up all over the world.
Some are showing resistance to vaccines and out-compete the original strains.
Predicting the next variant of concern will help researchers get ahead of the virus.
This project will explore and evaluate methods of predicting the next variant of concern.

This project aims to analyse several aspects of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus) using publicly available datasets with a focus on identifying or predicting the next variant of concern.

### Data resources

The first step might be to look at the data already available openly to researchers.
COG-UK have a great [set of resources](https://www.cogconsortium.uk/tools-analysis/public-data-analysis-2/) to explore and use in your hackathon research.
It would be great if you could familiarise yourself with some of those pages, but they are not always clear so please raise any issues asking questions and we will be happy to help answering them.

### Outcomes

We really do not want to push people in any specific direction if you have ideas on how to help scientists identify or predict variants of concern.
Scientific report on any variants that worry you in the data?
Sure!
A workflow package to say what protein has been changed?
Great!
Machine learning on fully simulated virus with all possible changes?
Good luck to you!

Of course these might seem like massive tasks, and you will have a lot of questions and that is how we can help out.
We will also be outlining some predefined projects that we think might be useful for the community, so feel free to contribute to those projects if you don't want to do your own.

## Contributing

### Choosing a contribution

Although we encourage you to develop your own novel methods that researchers may not have thought of, we have outlined some [projects](https://github.com/wgc-hackathon/covid/projects) to get started.

If you don't already have something specific you would like to contribute, project goals are tracked in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/wgc-hackathon/covid/issues).
Issues are flagged with if they require programming experience, documentation, code review, or "flat-file" data analysis for example in excel.


### GitHub best practice

Once you have decided which issue you want to contribute to, follow [the steps on this page](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/).
Note that step 9 is where you actually make changes to the data and code.
