# COVID-19 Open Data Analysis To Identify The Next Variant Of Concern

## Objective

COVID variants are cropping up all over the world.
Some are showing resistance to vaccines and out-compete the original strains.
Predicting the next variant of concern will help researchers get ahead of the virus.
This project will explore and evaluate methods of predicting the next variant of concern.

This project aims to analyse several aspects of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus) using publicly available datasets.
This project will primarily be performed using python and .csv flat-files.

## Contributing

### Choosing a contribution

Although we encourage you to develop your own novel methods that researchers may not have thought of, we have outlined some projects to get started.

If you don't already have something specific you would like to contribute, project goals are tracked in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/wgc-hackathon/covid/issues).
Issues are flagged with if they require programming experience, documentation, code review, or "flat-file" data analysis for example in excel.

### Data resources

The first step might be to look at the data already available openly to researchers.
COG-UK have a great [set of resources](https://www.cogconsortium.uk/tools-analysis/public-data-analysis-2/) to explore and use in your research.

### GitHub best practice

Once you have decided which issue you want to contribute to, follow [the steps on this page](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/).
Note that step 9 is where you actually make changes to the data and code.
